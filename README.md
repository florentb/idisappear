# I DISAPPEAR

"I DISAPPEAR" is a photograph that captures Boris's face with 20,000 pixels. The photo was taken in Paris on November 11, 2003. The number 20,000 represents roughly the number of days Boris has left to live. If Boris lives to 88, which is 20,000 days from the photo's date, he will be nearing the end of his life.

This photo is now available under the name [idisappear.net](http://www.idisappear.net/), and we have programmed a daily random replacement of a pixel in the photograph with a white one.

In 20,000 days, his face will have 20,000 white pixels, and on that day, it will have disappeared.
